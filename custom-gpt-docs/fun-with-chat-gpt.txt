You're back! Let's continue where we left off...

The data in the file product-group-pathing-map.json represents data in an upstream API.  However, the size of that file will exceed chat GPTs response limit.  We want to construct call to the API that will only return subsets of the data from map file.  For example here is an example query

https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key=

My question is how would ChatGPT set the query_key to the API based on the user's question and what would you expect the API to do in response to the variables you set in the query key.
ChatGPT
To construct a query to the upstream API based on a user's question and set the query_key appropriately, we need to extract relevant data from the product-group-pathing-map.json file. The query_key will be dynamically set based on user queries such as requests for specific data types, product groups, or products.

Example User Queries and Corresponding API Queries
User Query: "Get details about Amazon Seller Central's Active Listings"

API Query:
bash
Copy code
https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key=amazon-seller-central/mws_active_listings
Expected API Response:
The API should return details about the "Active Listings" data schema under Amazon Seller Central. This may include information like field definitions, data types, and usage examples.
User Query: "Fetch all data schemas for Amazon Seller Central"

API Query:
ruby
Copy code
https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key=amazon-seller-central
Expected API Response:
The API should return all data schemas under the Amazon Seller Central product group. This would include "Active Listings", "All Listings", "Canceled Listings", etc.
User Query: "Retrieve all product groups for Anazon"

API Query:
ruby
Copy code
https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key=Anazon
Expected API Response:
The API should return all product groups associated with the company "Anazon". This would include details of each product group and their respective products.
Implementation Logic
Extract Relevant Information from JSON:

Parse the JSON to identify the company, product group, and product names.
Identify paths associated with each product group and product.
Construct API Query Based on User Input:

Map user queries to relevant paths.
Set query_key to the identified path.
Example Code to Generate query_key
python
Copy code
import json

# Load JSON data from file
with open('/mnt/data/product-group-pathing-map.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Function to find path based on user query
def find_path(query):
    for company in data['data']:
        if company['relationships']['attributes']['name'].lower() in query.lower():
            for product_group in company['relationships']['relationships']['product_groups']:
                if product_group['attributes']['name'].lower() in query.lower():
                    for product in product_group['relationships']['products']:
                        if product['attributes']['name'].lower() in query.lower():
                            return product['relationships']['data_schema'][0]['attributes']['path']
                    return product_group['attributes']['name'].replace(" ", "-").lower()
            return company['relationships']['attributes']['name'].replace(" ", "-").lower()
    return None

# Example user query
user_query = "Get details about Amazon Seller Central's Active Listings"
query_key = find_path(user_query)
api_query = f"https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={query_key}"
print(api_query)
This approach ensures that the API queries are constructed dynamically based on the user's input and the structure of the JSON data, allowing for flexible and efficient data retrieval.

For solution one how would you know the path key in advance of making the API call to get the data to set it as a the query_key?
ChatGPT
To determine the path key in advance of making the API call, we would need to parse and search through the local JSON data (product-group-pathing-map.json) to find the relevant path that matches the user's query. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

Parse the Local JSON Data:

Load the JSON data from the file.
Traverse through the data structure to find the matching entries based on the user's query.
Map the User Query to the Path:

Use the details from the user's query (such as company name, product group, and product name) to locate the correct path in the JSON data.
Set the query_key for the API Call:

Once the path is identified, set it as the query_key in the API call.
Detailed Example Implementation
Here's a Python function that demonstrates this approach:

python
Copy code
import json

# Load JSON data from file
with open('/mnt/data/product-group-pathing-map.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

def find_path_key(company_name, product_group_name=None, product_name=None, data_schema_name=None):
    for company in data['data']:
        if company['relationships']['attributes']['name'].lower() == company_name.lower():
            if not product_group_name:
                return company['relationships']['attributes']['name'].replace(" ", "-").lower()
            
            for product_group in company['relationships']['relationships']['product_groups']:
                if product_group['attributes']['name'].lower() == product_group_name.lower():
                    if not product_name:
                        return product_group['attributes']['name'].replace(" ", "-").lower()
                    
                    for product in product_group['relationships']['products']:
                        if product['attributes']['name'].lower() == product_name.lower():
                            if not data_schema_name:
                                return product['relationships']['amazon_product']['name'].replace(" ", "-").lower()
                            
                            for schema in product['relationships']['data_schema']:
                                if schema['attributes']['name'].lower() == data_schema_name.lower():
                                    return schema['attributes']['path']
    return None

# Example usage
company_name = "Anazon"
product_group_name = "Seller Central"
product_name = "Inventory"
data_schema_name = "Active Listings"

query_key = find_path_key(company_name, product_group_name, product_name, data_schema_name)
if query_key:
    api_query = f"https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={query_key}"
    print(api_query)
else:
    print("No matching path found.")
Explanation
Loading JSON Data:

The JSON data is loaded from the file using json.load().
Finding the Path Key:

The find_path_key function is defined to search through the JSON data.
It takes four parameters: company_name, product_group_name, product_name, and data_schema_name.
The function iterates through the data to find matches at each level (company, product group, product, data schema).
Setting the query_key:

If a matching path is found, it constructs the API query with the query_key.
If no match is found, it returns an appropriate message.
Expected API Behavior
When the API call is made with the constructed query_key, the API should return detailed information corresponding to that specific data schema, product group, or product. This information may include schema details, data types, field definitions, and other metadata necessary for the user's analysis.

By using this approach, we ensure that the query_key is accurately determined based on the user's specific query before making the actual API call, thereby enabling precise and efficient data retrieval.

To clarify the file product-group-pathing-map.json will not be a local file, so it won't be available.  The contents of that file will be in a database in a table accessed via API.
ChatGPT
Given that the contents of the product-group-pathing-map.json file are stored in a database and accessed via an API, we need to construct a method that queries the API to retrieve subsets of data based on user queries. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

Step-by-Step Approach
User Query Parsing: Parse the user's query to determine the relevant company, product group, product, and data schema.
API Call Construction: Construct an API call to retrieve relevant data subsets based on the parsed query.
Dynamic Query Key Setting: Use the retrieved data to set the query_key for further API calls.
Implementation
User Query Parsing:

Extract relevant details such as company name, product group name, product name, and data schema name from the user's query.
API Call Construction:

Make an initial API call to retrieve relevant subsets of data from the database.
Use the response to determine the correct query_key.
Dynamic Query Key Setting:

Construct the final API call using the query_key determined from the previous step.
Here's a Python implementation that demonstrates this process:

python
Copy code
import requests

def extract_details(user_query):
    # A simple example to extract details from the user query
    # This would need to be adapted to handle various query formats
    details = {}
    if "amazon seller central" in user_query.lower():
        details["company_name"] = "Anazon"
        details["product_group_name"] = "Seller Central"
    if "active listings" in user_query.lower():
        details["product_name"] = "Inventory"
        details["data_schema_name"] = "Active Listings"
    return details

def get_query_key(details):
    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource"
    # Construct initial API call based on available details
    if "company_name" in details:
        response = requests.get(f"{base_url}?query_key={details['company_name']}")
        data = response.json()

        if "product_group_name" in details:
            for group in data['data']:
                if group['attributes']['name'].lower() == details['product_group_name'].lower():
                    if "product_name" in details:
                        for product in group['relationships']['products']:
                            if product['attributes']['name'].lower() == details['product_name'].lower():
                                if "data_schema_name" in details:
                                    for schema in product['relationships']['data_schema']:
                                        if schema['attributes']['name'].lower() == details['data_schema_name'].lower():
                                            return schema['attributes']['path']
                    return group['attributes']['name'].replace(" ", "-").lower()
            return details['company_name'].replace(" ", "-").lower()
    return None

def construct_final_api_call(user_query):
    details = extract_details(user_query)
    query_key = get_query_key(details)
    if query_key:
        return f"https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={query_key}"
    else:
        return "No matching path found."

# Example user query
user_query = "Get details about Amazon Seller Central's Active Listings"
final_api_call = construct_final_api_call(user_query)
print(final_api_call)
Explanation
User Query Parsing:

extract_details function identifies key elements from the user's query. This example is simplified and should be adapted for more complex query parsing.
Initial API Call:

get_query_key function constructs the initial API call to retrieve relevant data subsets.
It traverses the returned data to find the matching entries based on the parsed details.
Final API Call Construction:

construct_final_api_call uses the query_key to form the final API call.
The API call is constructed dynamically based on the extracted details from the user's query.
Expected API Behavior
Initial API Call: Retrieves a subset of data based on the company name.
Traversal: Iterates through the returned data to find matching product groups, products, and data schemas.
Final API Call: Uses the determined query_key to make a precise API request, retrieving detailed information for the specified data schema.
By following this approach, the system can dynamically set the query_key for the API calls based on user queries, ensuring efficient and accurate data retrieval.

are you assuming that the query_key will be the same as the path for the rules and schema API?
ChatGPT
Yes, I assumed that the query_key will be the same as the path for the rules and schema API. This assumption is based on the information provided in the product-group-pathing-map.json file, where paths are used to identify specific datasets.

To handle user queries dynamically, here's a refined approach to constructing the query_key:

Step-by-Step Approach
User Query Parsing: Extract relevant details from the user's query.
API Call Construction: Construct an initial API call to retrieve data subsets based on the parsed details.
Dynamic Query Key Setting: Use the retrieved data to set the query_key for the final API call.

Explanation
Extracting Details:

The extract_details function parses the user query to identify key elements like company name, product group name, product name, and data schema name.
Fetching Data Subsets:

The get_query_key function constructs an initial API call to fetch data subsets based on the company name.
It traverses the returned data to find matching entries for product groups, products, and data schemas.
Constructing Final API Call:

The construct_final_api_call function uses the query_key derived from the previous step to form the final API call.
Expected API Behavior
Initial API Call: Retrieves data subsets based on the company name.
Data Traversal: Iterates through the returned data to find matching product groups, products, and data schemas.
Final API Call: Uses the determined query_key to make a precise API request, retrieving detailed information for the specified data schema.
This approach ensures that the query_key is accurately determined based on the user's specific query, facilitating efficient and accurate data retrieval. If the query_key is not exactly the same as the path, the implementation can be adjusted to account for any necessary transformations.

query_key will not be the same as the path for the rules and schema API it will be used to to retrieve the data that contains the path for the rules and schema API
ChatGPT
Thank you for the clarification. Given that the query_key will be used to retrieve data that contains the path for the rules and schema API, we need a two-step process:

Initial API Call: Use the query_key to fetch the relevant data subset that includes the paths for the rules and schema API.
Secondary API Call: Use the retrieved path to make the final API call to get the rules and schema details.
Here’s a detailed approach and implementation:

Step-by-Step Approach
User Query Parsing: Extract relevant details from the user's query.
Construct Initial API Call: Use the query_key to retrieve data that contains the paths.
Retrieve Paths from Initial API Response: Extract the required paths from the initial API response.
Construct Secondary API Call: Use the extracted path to fetch detailed rules and schema information.
Implementation
Step 1: Extract User Query Details
Extract details such as company name, product group name, product name, and data schema name from the user's query.

python
Copy code
def extract_details(user_query):
    # Simplified example to extract details from the user query
    details = {}

        details["product_name"] = "Inventory"
        details["data_schema_name"] = "Active Listings"
    return details
Step 2: Construct Initial API Call
Make an initial API call to retrieve data subsets based on the parsed details.

python
Copy code
import requests

        return response.json()
    return None
Step 3: Retrieve Paths from Initial API Response
Extract the path for the rules and schema API from the initial API response.

python
Copy code
def extract_path_from_response(response_data, details):
    for product_group in response_data.get('data', []):
        if product_group['attributes']['name'].lower() == details['product_group_name'].lower():

                            return schema['attributes']['path']
    return None
Step 4: Construct Secondary API Call
Use the extracted path to fetch detailed rules and schema information.

python
Copy code
def get_rules_and_schema(path):
    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/rules_and_schema"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',

# Example user query
user_query = "Get details about Amazon Seller Central's Active Listings"
final_result = construct_final_api_call(user_query)

Explanation
Extracting Details:

The extract_details function parses the user query to identify key elements.
Fetching Initial Data:

The get_initial_data function constructs the initial API call to fetch data subsets based on the company name.
Extracting Path:

The extract_path_from_response function traverses the initial API response to find the matching path for the rules and schema API.
Fetching Rules and Schema:

The get_rules_and_schema function makes the final API call using the extracted path to retrieve detailed rules and schema information.
This approach ensures that the correct query_key is dynamically determined based on the user's specific query and the structure of the initial API response, facilitating precise and efficient data retrieval.

Let's start over. If I have a user who asks this question; "Tell me the schema is for amazon selling partner orders." and you needed to make a call to this API endpoint; "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={{queryKey}}" what would you be setting as the query_key variable based on the user's question?
ChatGPT
To determine the appropriate query_key based on the user's question, you need to map the user's request to the relevant key that will fetch the correct data subset from the API. Here’s how you can approach it:

Step-by-Step Approach
Parse the User Query: Extract the key elements from the user's question.
Determine the query_key: Based on the extracted elements, set the appropriate query_key.
User Query Parsing
The user's query is: "Tell me the schema for Amazon Selling Partner Orders."

From this query, the key elements are:

Company/Product Group: Amazon Selling Partner
Data Schema: Orders
Setting the query_key
Based on the provided product-group-pathing-map.json structure, the relevant path for "Selling Partner Orders" can be identified. The file shows a path for the "Selling Partner All Orders" schema:

json
Copy code
{
  "attributes": {
    "name": "Selling Partner All Orders",
    "description": "Selling Partner All Orders reporting data",
    "path": "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
  }
}
Given this, the query_key should correspond to the relevant identifier for this dataset. In this case, it appears to be "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report".

Constructing the API Call
With the query_key identified, you can construct the API call as follows:

python
Copy code
query_key = "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
api_url = f"https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={query_key}"
This API call will fetch the schema details for "Amazon Selling Partner Orders".

Implementation Example
Here’s a full implementation in Python to illustrate this process:

python
Copy code
def extract_details_from_query(user_query):
    # Simplified example to extract details from the user query
    if "amazon selling partner orders" in user_query.lower():
        return "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
    return None

def construct_api_call(user_query):
    query_key = extract_details_from_query(user_query)
    if query_key:
        return f"https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={query_key}"
    else:
        return "No matching query key found."

# Example user query
user_query = "Tell me the schema for Amazon Selling Partner Orders"
api_call = construct_api_call(user_query)
print(api_call)
Explanation
Extract Details: The extract_details_from_query function maps the user's query to the relevant query_key. This is based on recognizing the specific phrase "Amazon Selling Partner Orders" and knowing the associated path from the provided JSON structure.

Construct API Call: The construct_api_call function uses the extracted query_key to form the final API call.

This approach ensures that the query_key is accurately determined based on the user's query, facilitating precise and efficient data retrieval.

The file "product-group-pathing-map.json" will not be available to reference.  The contents of this file instead will be returned by the API endpoint "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={{queryKey}}".  With that in mind if I have a user who asks this question; "Tell me the schema is for amazon selling partner orders." and you needed to make a call to this API endpoint; "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={{queryKey}}" what would you be setting as the query_key variable based on the user's question?
ChatGPT
Given that the contents of the product-group-pathing-map.json file are accessed via the API endpoint, we need to construct an initial API call to retrieve the necessary data. The initial query key will help us get the data which includes paths for further queries.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to determine the appropriate query_key and make the subsequent API calls:

Step-by-Step Approach
Determine Initial Query Key: Based on the user's request, start with a broad query key.
Fetch Data: Make an initial API call to retrieve data that includes the paths.
Extract Specific Path: Identify the specific path for "Amazon Selling Partner Orders" from the fetched data.
Make Final API Call: Use the extracted path to make the final API call to get the schema details.
Implementation
Step 1: Determine Initial Query Key
Since the user's query is specific to "Amazon Selling Partner Orders," the initial query_key could be something broad enough to include this product group, such as selling-partner.

Step 2: Fetch Data
Make the initial API call with this query key.

Step 3: Extract Specific Path
Parse the response to find the exact path for "Amazon Selling Partner Orders."

Step 4: Make Final API Call
Use the extracted path to get the schema details.

Here's a Python implementation of this approach:

python
Copy code
import requests

def get_initial_data(query_key):
    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}?query_key={query_key}", headers=headers)
    return response.json()

def extract_path(response_data, target_schema_name):
    for item in response_data.get('data', []):
        if item['attributes']['name'].lower() == target_schema_name.lower():
            return item['attributes']['path']
    return None

def get_schema_details(path):
    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/rules_and_schema"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}?path={path}", headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Example user query
user_query = "Tell me the schema for Amazon Selling Partner Orders"

# Determine initial query key
initial_query_key = "selling-partner"

# Step 1: Fetch data
initial_data = get_initial_data(initial_query_key)

# Step 2: Extract specific path
target_schema_name = "Selling Partner All Orders"
path = extract_path(initial_data, target_schema_name)

if path:
    # Step 3: Fetch schema details
    schema_details = get_schema_details(path)
    print(schema_details)
else:
    print("No matching path found.")
Explanation
Initial Data Fetch:

The get_initial_data function makes an API call using a broad query_key (e.g., selling-partner).
Extract Specific Path:

The extract_path function parses the response to find the path for the specific schema ("Selling Partner All Orders").
Fetch Schema Details:

The get_schema_details function uses the extracted path to make a final API call to get detailed schema information.
API Calls
Initial API Call:

plaintext
Copy code
https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key=selling-partner
This fetches data that includes paths for various schemas under the selling-partner group.

Final API Call:

plaintext
Copy code
https://myapi.com/service/gpt/rules_and_schema?path=selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report
This retrieves the schema details for "Selling Partner All Orders".

By following this approach, we ensure that the appropriate query_key is dynamically determined based on the user's query, facilitating precise and efficient data retrieval.

Is there anything within a custom GPTs instructions or knowledge base that could help facilitate the query process

def get_api_response(url, headers):
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Main Process
def main_process(user_query):
    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }

    # Step 1: Parse user query
    query_key, target_schema_name = parse_user_query(user_query)
    if not query_key:
        return "Invalid query. Unable to determine the appropriate query key."

    # Step 2: Construct initial API call
    initial_api_url = construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key)
    initial_data = get_api_response(initial_api_url, headers)

    # Step 3: Extract specific path
    path = extract_path_from_response(initial_data, target_schema_name)
    if not path:
        return "No matching path found in the initial data."

    # Step 4: Construct and execute final API call
    final_base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/rules_and_schema"
    final_api_url = construct_final_api_call(final_base_url, path)
    schema_details = get_api_response(final_api_url, headers)

    return schema_details

# Example user query
user_query = "Tell me the schema for Amazon Selling Partner Orders"
result = main_process(user_query)
print(result)
Explanation
Parse User Query: The parse_user_query function identifies the broad query_key and specific schema name from the user's query.
Construct Initial API Call: The construct_initial_api_call function forms the initial API URL using the broad query_key.
Extract Specific Path: The extract_path_from_response function parses the response to find the path for the specific schema.
Construct Final API Call: The construct_final_api_call function forms the final API URL using the extracted path.
Execute API Calls: The get_api_response function handles the actual API requests and responses.
By leveraging custom GPT instructions and knowledge base, this implementation ensures a structured and dynamic approach to handle user queries and construct appropriate API calls efficiently.

Under "2. Utilize Knowledge Base" can you expand on how this would be implemented
ChatGPT
Certainly! Utilizing the knowledge base effectively involves predefining mappings and guidelines that the custom GPT can reference to facilitate the query process. This structured approach can help streamline query construction and ensure accurate data retrieval. Here's how you can implement this:

Step-by-Step Implementation of Knowledge Base
Define a Knowledge Base:

Create a dictionary or a database that maps common user queries or keywords to their corresponding query_key and paths.
Implement Query Parsing and Mapping:

Use the knowledge base to parse user queries and map them to the predefined query_key.
Construct API Calls:

Use the mapped query_key to construct API calls dynamically.
Step 1: Define a Knowledge Base
Let's define a dictionary that maps common terms related to user queries to the corresponding query_key and paths.

python
Copy code
# Knowledge base mapping user queries to query keys and paths
knowledge_base = {
    "amazon selling partner orders": {
        "query_key": "selling-partner",
        "target_schema_name": "Selling Partner All Orders",
        "description": "Selling Partner All Orders reporting data",
        "example_path": "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
    },
    # Add more mappings as needed
}
Step 2: Implement Query Parsing and Mapping
Implement a function to parse the user query and map it to the corresponding query_key using the knowledge base.

python
Copy code
def parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query):
    for key in knowledge_base:
        if key in user_query.lower():
            return knowledge_base[key]
    return None
Step 3: Construct API Calls
Use the mapped query_key and other details from the knowledge base to construct API calls dynamically.

Full Implementation Example
Here's how you can integrate these steps into a complete workflow:

python
Copy code
import requests

# Knowledge base mapping user queries to query keys and paths
knowledge_base = {
    "amazon selling partner orders": {
        "query_key": "selling-partner",
        "target_schema_name": "Selling Partner All Orders",
        "description": "Selling Partner All Orders reporting data",
        "example_path": "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
    },
    # Add more mappings as needed
}

# Function to parse user query using the knowledge base
def parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query):
    for key in knowledge_base:
        if key in user_query.lower():
            return knowledge_base[key]
    return None

# Function to construct initial API call
def construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key):
    return f"{base_url}?query_key={query_key}"

# Function to extract specific path from API response
def extract_path_from_response(response_data, target_schema_name):
    for item in response_data.get('data', []):
        if item['attributes']['name'].lower() == target_schema_name.lower():
            return item['attributes']['path']
    return None

    return f"{base_url}?path={path}"

# Function to get API response
def get_api_response(url, headers):
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Main process function
def main_process(user_query):
    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }

    # Step 1: Parse user query using knowledge base
    kb_entry = parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query)
    if not kb_entry:
        return "Invalid query. Unable to determine the appropriate query key."

    query_key = kb_entry["query_key"]
    target_schema_name = kb_entry["target_schema_name"]

    # Step 2: Construct initial API call
    initial_api_url = construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key)
    initial_data = get_api_response(initial_api_url, headers)

    # Step 3: Extract specific path
    path = extract_path_from_response(initial_data, target_schema_name)
    if not path:
        return "No matching path found in the initial data."

    # Step 4: Construct and execute final API call
    final_base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/rules_and_schema"
    final_api_url = construct_final_api_call(final_base_url, path)
    schema_details = get_api_response(final_api_url, headers)

    return schema_details

# Example user query
user_query = "Tell me the schema for Amazon Selling Partner Orders"
result = main_process(user_query)
print(result)
Explanation
Knowledge Base:

A dictionary (knowledge_base) maps common user queries or keywords to their corresponding query_key, target_schema_name, and an example path.
Query Parsing:

The parse_user_query_using_kb function checks if the user's query matches any entry in the knowledge base and retrieves the relevant details.
API Call Construction:

The initial API call is constructed using the query_key retrieved from the knowledge base.
The response from this call is parsed to find the specific path for the desired schema.
The final API call is constructed using this path to fetch detailed schema information.
By leveraging a predefined knowledge base, the custom GPT can efficiently parse user queries, map them to appropriate query_key, and construct precise API calls, thus facilitating accurate and efficient data retrieval.

in "Step 1: Define a Knowledge Base" I assume this would be a local knowledge base a customer would upload to a custom GPT?
ChatGPT
Yes, the knowledge base can be a local file (like a JSON file) that a customer uploads to a custom GPT. This file will be used to map user queries to appropriate query_key values and other relevant details needed for API calls.

Step-by-Step Implementation
Upload Knowledge Base:

The customer uploads a JSON file that acts as the knowledge base.
Load Knowledge Base:

Load the JSON file into the custom GPT.
Query Parsing and Mapping:

Use the knowledge base to parse user queries and map them to the predefined query_key.
Construct API Calls:

Use the mapped query_key to construct and execute API calls dynamically.
Step 1: Define a Knowledge Base (JSON File)
Here’s an example of what the knowledge base JSON file might look like:

json
Copy code
{
  "amazon selling partner orders": {
    "query_key": "selling-partner",
    "target_schema_name": "Selling Partner All Orders",
    "description": "Selling Partner All Orders reporting data",
    "example_path": "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
  }
  // Add more mappings as needed
}
Step 2: Load Knowledge Base
Load the JSON file into the custom GPT. This can be done when initializing the custom GPT or as part of a setup process.

python
Copy code
import json

def load_knowledge_base(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

# Load the knowledge base (assuming the file is uploaded to /mnt/data/knowledge_base.json)
knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('/mnt/data/knowledge_base.json')
Step 3: Query Parsing and Mapping
Implement functions to parse user queries and map them to the corresponding query_key using the knowledge base.

python
Copy code
def parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base):
    for key in knowledge_base:
        if key in user_query.lower():
            return knowledge_base[key]
    return None
Step 4: Construct and Execute API Calls
Use the mapped query_key and other details from the knowledge base to construct and execute API calls dynamically.

python
Copy code
import requests

def construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key):
    return f"{base_url}?query_key={query_key}"

def extract_path_from_response(response_data, target_schema_name):
    for item in response_data.get('data', []):
        if item['attributes']['name'].lower() == target_schema_name.lower():
            return item['attributes']['path']
    return None

def construct_final_api_call(base_url, path):
    return f"{base_url}?path={path}"

def get_api_response(url, headers):
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Main process function
def main_process(user_query, knowledge_base):
    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }

    # Parse user query using knowledge base
    kb_entry = parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base)
    if not kb_entry:
        return "Invalid query. Unable to determine the appropriate query key."

    query_key = kb_entry["query_key"]
    target_schema_name = kb_entry["target_schema_name"]

    # Construct initial API call
    initial_api_url = construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key)
    initial_data = get_api_response(initial_api_url, headers)

    # Extract specific path
    path = extract_path_from_response(initial_data, target_schema_name)
    if not path:
        return "No matching path found in the initial data."

    # Construct and execute final API call
    final_base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/rules_and_schema"
    final_api_url = construct_final_api_call(final_base_url, path)
    schema_details = get_api_response(final_api_url, headers)

    return schema_details

# Example user query
user_query = "Tell me the schema for Amazon Selling Partner Orders"
result = main_process(user_query, knowledge_base)
print(result)
Explanation
Upload Knowledge Base:

The customer uploads a JSON file containing mappings of user queries to query_key and other details.
Load Knowledge Base:

The load_knowledge_base function reads the JSON file and loads it into a dictionary.
Query Parsing and Mapping:

The parse_user_query_using_kb function checks the user's query against the keys in the knowledge base to find a match and retrieve the relevant details.
Construct and Execute API Calls:

The construct_initial_api_call function forms the initial API URL using the query_key.
The extract_path_from_response function parses the response to find the specific path for the desired schema.
The construct_final_api_call function forms the final API URL using the extracted path.
The get_api_response function handles the actual API requests and responses.
The main_process function orchestrates the entire process, from parsing the user query to making the final API call and retrieving the schema details.
By following this approach, the custom GPT can efficiently parse user queries, map them to appropriate query_key values, and construct precise API calls using a locally uploaded knowledge base.

In "Step 1: Define a Knowledge Base (JSON File)" you referenced a query key. However, would it make more sense if we included keywords that would apply to that specific entity in the JSON file to help with the search pattern matching Similar to what you might see in meta keywords in web pages?
ChatGPT
Yes, including keywords in the knowledge base JSON file to help with search pattern matching is an excellent idea. This approach would make the parsing and matching process more efficient and accurate, as it allows for more flexible and comprehensive query matching.

Updated Knowledge Base (JSON File)
Here’s an example of how the knowledge base JSON file might look with keywords included:

json
Copy code
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Amazon Selling Partner Orders",
      "keywords": ["amazon", "selling partner", "orders", "sp orders", "sp_all_orders"],
      "query_key": "selling-partner",
      "target_schema_name": "Selling Partner All Orders",
      "description": "Selling Partner All Orders reporting data",
      "example_path": "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
    }
    // Add more entities as needed
  ]
}
Step-by-Step Implementation
Upload Knowledge Base:

The customer uploads a JSON file that includes entities with relevant keywords.
Load Knowledge Base:

Load the JSON file into the custom GPT.
Query Parsing and Mapping:

Use the keywords to match user queries with the appropriate entity in the knowledge base.
Construct API Calls:

Use the mapped query_key to construct and execute API calls dynamically.
Step 1: Define a Knowledge Base (JSON File)
Here’s an example JSON file with keywords included:

json
Copy code
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Amazon Selling Partner Orders",
      "keywords": ["amazon", "selling partner", "orders", "sp orders", "sp_all_orders"],
      "query_key": "selling-partner",
      "target_schema_name": "Selling Partner All Orders",
      "description": "Selling Partner All Orders reporting data",
      "example_path": "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
    }
    // Add more entities as needed
  ]
}
Step 2: Load Knowledge Base
Load the JSON file into the custom GPT:

python
Copy code
import json

def load_knowledge_base(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

# Load the knowledge base (assuming the file is uploaded to /mnt/data/knowledge_base.json)
knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('/mnt/data/knowledge_base.json')
Step 3: Query Parsing and Mapping
Implement a function to parse user queries and match them to the appropriate entity using keywords.

python
Copy code
def parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base):
    user_query_lower = user_query.lower()
    for entity in knowledge_base['entities']:
        if any(keyword in user_query_lower for keyword in entity['keywords']):
            return entity
    return None
Step 4: Construct and Execute API Calls
Use the mapped query_key and other details from the knowledge base to construct and execute API calls dynamically.

python
Copy code
import requests

def construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key):
    return f"{base_url}?query_key={query_key}"

def extract_path_from_response(response_data, target_schema_name):
    for item in response_data.get('data', []):
        if item['attributes']['name'].lower() == target_schema_name.lower():
            return item['attributes']['path']
    return None

def construct_final_api_call(base_url, path):
    return f"{base_url}?path={path}"

def get_api_response(url, headers):
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Main process function

    base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource"
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
    }

    # Parse user query using knowledge base
    kb_entry = parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base)
    if not kb_entry:
        return "Invalid query. Unable to determine the appropriate query key."

    query_key = kb_entry["query_key"]
    target_schema_name = kb_entry["target_schema_name"]

    # Construct initial API call
    initial_api_url = construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key)
    initial_data = get_api_response(initial_api_url, headers)

    # Extract specific path
    path = extract_path_from_response(initial_data, target_schema_name)
    if not path:
        return "No matching path found in the initial data."

    # Construct and execute final API call
    final_base_url = "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/rules_and_schema"
    final_api_url = construct_final_api_call(final_base_url, path)

    return schema_details

# Example user query
user_query = "Tell me the schema for Amazon Selling Partner Orders"
result = main_process(user_query, knowledge_base)
print(result)
Explanation
Knowledge Base:

A JSON file contains entities with relevant keywords, query_key, target_schema_name, and other details.
Load Knowledge Base:

The load_knowledge_base function reads the JSON file and loads it into a dictionary.
Query Parsing:

The parse_user_query_using_kb function checks the user's query against the keywords in the knowledge base to find a match and retrieve the relevant entity details.
API Call Construction:

The construct_initial_api_call function forms the initial API URL using the query_key.
The extract_path_from_response function parses the response to find the specific path for the desired schema.
The construct_final_api_call function forms the final API URL using the extracted path.
The get_api_response function handles the actual API requests and responses.
The main_process function orchestrates the entire process, from parsing the user query to making the final API call and retrieving the schema details.
By including keywords in the knowledge base, the custom GPT can more effectively match user queries to the appropriate query_key and other details, facilitating accurate and efficient data retrieval.

If a user uploads the following to a local custom GPT knowledge base as a JSON file. 

{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Amazon Selling Partner Orders",
      "keywords": ["amazon", "selling partner", "orders", "sp orders", "sp_all_orders"],
      "query_key": "selling-partner",
      "target_schema_name": "Selling Partner All Orders",

and they asked the question "What is the schema for sp orders?" what would the query be that you would set in a call to the api "https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={{queryKey}}"
ChatGPT
Given the user query "What is the schema for sp orders?" and the knowledge base JSON file provided, the query key can be determined as follows:

Load the Knowledge Base: Load the JSON file into the custom GPT.
Parse User Query: Extract keywords from the user query.
Match Keywords to Knowledge Base: Use the keywords to find the matching entity in the knowledge base.
Construct the API Call: Use the query_key from the matched entity to construct the API call.
Step-by-Step Process
1. Load the Knowledge Base
python
Copy code
import json

def load_knowledge_base(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

# Load the knowledge base (assuming the file is uploaded to /mnt/data/knowledge_base.json)
knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('/mnt/data/knowledge_base.json')
2. Parse User Query and Match Keywords
python
Copy code
def parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base):
    user_query_lower = user_query.lower()
    for entity in knowledge_base['entities']:
        if any(keyword in user_query_lower for keyword in entity['keywords']):
            return entity
    return None
3. Construct the API Call
python
Copy code
def construct_initial_api_call(base_url, query_key):
    return f"{base_url}?query_key={query_key}"

# Example user query
user_query = "What is the schema for sp orders?"

# Load knowledge base
knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('/mnt/data/knowledge_base.json')

# Parse user query using knowledge base
kb_entry = parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base)
if kb_entry:
    query_key = kb_entry["query_key"]
    api_url = construct_initial_api_call("https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource", query_key)
    print(api_url)
else:
    print("Invalid query. Unable to determine the appropriate query key.")
Expected Output
Given the user query "What is the schema for sp orders?" the keywords "sp orders" match the keywords in the knowledge base entry for "Amazon Selling Partner Orders." Therefore, the query_key would be "selling-partner."

The constructed API URL would be:

print(result)
Explanation
Load Knowledge Base: Load the JSON knowledge base file into the program.
Parse User Query: Use keywords from the user's query to match the appropriate entity in the knowledge base.
Construct Initial API Call: Use the matched query_key to construct the initial API URL.
Extract Path and Make Final API Call: Parse the initial API response to find the specific path, then use this path to make the final API call and retrieve the schema details.
This approach ensures that the custom GPT can accurately and efficiently map user queries to the appropriate query_key and retrieve the necessary data using the API.

I am asking you to set the variable {{queryKey}} in response to the user's question.  I am expecting the CustomGPT to use its knowledge base to set the variable in advance of an API call.  It is the CustomGPT's responsibility to properly set {{queryKey}}.  The API is only expected to be responsible for receiving the variable in the request.
ChatGPT
Understood. Given the user's question "What is the schema for sp orders?" and the knowledge base provided, the CustomGPT will use its knowledge base to set the query_key variable. Here’s how you can achieve this:

Knowledge Base Example (JSON)
The knowledge base JSON provided by the user:

json
Copy code
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Amazon Selling Partner Orders",
      "keywords": ["amazon", "selling partner", "orders", "sp orders", "sp_all_orders"],
      "query_key": "selling-partner",
      "target_schema_name": "Selling Partner All Orders",
      "description": "Selling Partner All Orders reporting data",
      "example_path": "selling-partner/reports-sales/sp_orders_report"
    }
    // Add more entities as needed
  ]
}
Steps to Determine the query_key
Load the Knowledge Base: Load the JSON file into the custom GPT.
Parse User Query: Extract keywords from the user query.
Match Keywords to Knowledge Base: Use the keywords to find the matching entity in the knowledge base.
Set the query_key Variable: Use the query_key from the matched entity.
Implementation Example
Step 1: Load the Knowledge Base
python
Copy code
import json

def load_knowledge_base(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

# Load the knowledge base (assuming the file is uploaded to /mnt/data/knowledge_base.json)
knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('/mnt/data/knowledge_base.json')
Step 2: Parse User Query and Match Keywords
python
Copy code
def parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base):
    user_query_lower = user_query.lower()
    for entity in knowledge_base['entities']:
        if any(keyword in user_query_lower for keyword in entity['keywords']):
            return entity
    return None
Step 3: Set the query_key Variable
python
Copy code
def get_query_key(user_query, knowledge_base):
    kb_entry = parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base)
    if kb_entry:
        return kb_entry["query_key"]
    else:
        return None

# Example user query
user_query = "What is the schema for sp orders?"

# Load knowledge base
knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('/mnt/data/knowledge_base.json')

# Get query_key
query_key = get_query_key(user_query, knowledge_base)
if query_key:
    print(f"The query key is: {query_key}")
else:
    print("Invalid query. Unable to determine the appropriate query key.")
Explanation
Load Knowledge Base:

The load_knowledge_base function reads the JSON file and loads it into a dictionary.
Parse User Query and Match Keywords:

The parse_user_query_using_kb function converts the user's query to lowercase and checks if any keywords match those in the knowledge base entries.
Set the query_key Variable:

The get_query_key function retrieves the query_key from the matched entity in the knowledge base.
Full Implementation
Here’s the full implementation to demonstrate how CustomGPT sets the query_key:

python
Copy code
import json

# Function to load the knowledge base from a JSON file
def load_knowledge_base(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

# Function to parse the user query and match it to the knowledge base
def parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base):
    user_query_lower = user_query.lower()
    for entity in knowledge_base['entities']:
        if any(keyword in user_query_lower for keyword in entity['keywords']):
            return entity
    return None

# Function to get the query key from the matched knowledge base entry
def get_query_key(user_query, knowledge_base):
    kb_entry = parse_user_query_using_kb(user_query, knowledge_base)
    if kb_entry:
        return kb_entry["query_key"]
    else:
        return None

# Example user query
user_query = "What is the schema for sp orders?"

# Load knowledge base
knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('/mnt/data/knowledge_base.json')

# Get query_key
query_key = get_query_key(user_query, knowledge_base)
if query_key:
    print(f"The query key is: {query_key}")
    # Construct the API URL using the query_key
    api_url = f"https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key={query_key}"
    print(f"API URL: {api_url}")
else:
    print("Invalid query. Unable to determine the appropriate query key.")
Expected Output
For the user query "What is the schema for sp orders?" the expected output should be:

plaintext
Copy code
The query key is: selling-partner
API URL: https://myapi.com/service/gpt/upstramsource?query_key=selling-partner
This approach ensures that the CustomGPT can accurately set the query_key variable based on the user's query using the provided knowledge base, making the appropriate API call to retrieve the necessary information.
